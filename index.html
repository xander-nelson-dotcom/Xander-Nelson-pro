      <p>
        As I progress academically and professionally, I hope to build meaningful connections and leave a positive impact wherever
        I work. I have set my professional goals to be focused on careers that seamlessly involve
        brand management and public-facing corporate roles, likely leading to positions such as chief brand officer.
        Regardless of whichever company I'm a part of, I want to see people as people, not numbers, and look for ways to improve their lives in impactful ways.
      </p>

        <li>I love friendly competition — games, sports, challenges — anything that brings people together.</li>
        <li>I'm always trying to grow personally, whether spiritually, mentally, or through learning new things.</li>
